    <h1>Hot Days Per Month In Phoenix Last Year (2018)</h1>

    <p>
        We saw from the last chart that there were a considerable amount of days where the daily
        high temperature was 100&deg;F (38&deg;C) or higher.

    <p>
        In most places across the US, we would consider the "hot" months to be those which fall in
        the summer months (from roughly June to September). But we've already seen that in Phoenix,
        100&deg;F temperatures exist for six months of the year. Let's explore this  more.

    <p>
        Use the slider to control the cutoff temperature. The chart below will update to show the percentage of days
        per month and per year where the high temperature was equal or above the cutoff temperature.

    <div id="controls">
        <input id="tempSlider" type="range" name="points" min="30" max="130">
        <span id="cutoffValue"></span><span>&deg;</span>
        <select id="unitSelect">
            <option value="f">Fahrenheit</option>
            <option value="c">Celsius</option>
        </select>

    <p>
        We can see that over 35% of the days (roughly 128) - spread over six months - last year reached a temperature of 100&deg;F (38&deg;C) or hotter.
        Almost 50% of he days - spread over eight months - last year reached a temperature of 90&deg;F (32&deg;C) or hotter. Furthermore,
        we see that Phoenix experienced temperatures of 110&deg;F (43&deg;C) or more spread over three months.

        So far it appears the Phoenix is living up to its reputation as a hot city. In the first chart we saw a summary of
        daily temperatures for last year. In this chart we saw how hot days were distributed across each month last year.
        As a final step, let's take a look at at the temperatures throughout a given day.
