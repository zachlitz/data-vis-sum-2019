    Called the "Valley of the Sun", Phoenix is known for it's dry desert climate and its consistently extreme summer time temperatures. But how hot is it really?

    We're going to explore climate data from the <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov">NOAA</a> in order to get a better idea of what Phoenix weather is really
