    <h1>Hourly Temperature Data In Phoenix Last Year (2018</h1>
    <p>
        At this point we have a good idea of what the temperatures looked like in Phoenix for 2018.
        We've seen there are plenty of days (35%) where the temperature was above 100&deg;F (38&deg;C)
        and even more (almost 50%) days where the temperature was 90&deg;F (32&deg;C) or hotter.
    </p>
    <p>
        But the daily high temperature does not tell us the whole story.
        For instance, if Phoenix stays moderately cool until late in the morning or afternoon before
        reaching the high temperature, and/or cools down early in the evening, then it might not feel
        like Phoenix is really as hot as it initially appears.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to investigate this further, we will look at a final visualization. This visualization will show each day
        in a selected month as a heat map of the temperatures throughout the day where the intensity of the value is relative to the
        day's high temperature. We can also select a single day slice from the heat map to see a scatter plot of the daily
        relative temperature as a function of the time.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Use the controls below to set the month and day (you can also click the heat map to select a day) you want to see hourly
        temperature data for. The temperatures are displayed relative to the highest and lowest temperatures for <em>that</em>
        particular day (the red color represents the high for the respective day, and blue represents the low for the respective day).
    </p>
    <p>
        For the two-dimensional heat map, the hours run horizontally and the days (of the month) run vertically. The scatter plot and
        the heat map share a horizontal (time) axis from 12:00 AM to 11:00 PM, and the colors representing the daily relative temperatures
        are identical.

    <p>
        These two visualization show us that hot days are hot from early in the morning to late into the evening.
        We can see that in July (usually the hottest month) the temperature typically begins to rise substantially starting
        around 8-9 AM and can reach near high temperatures by 10-11 AM. These high temperatures can stay until 8-9 PM and not
        really cool too much until after 10-11 PM (still being 100&deg;F (38&deg;C) or over at this time), meaning that a summer day
        can easily be over 100&deg;F (38&deg;C) for 12-14 hours in the day.
    </p>

    <p>
        We have seen three visualizations for Phoenix temperatures. We have seen a chart of daily temperatures throughout last year (2018),
        a chart that show the proportion of hot days per month and over the year, and a heat map showing hourly temperatures throughout the day.
    </p>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
        These visualization have show three things:
        <ol>
            <li>Temperatures are high through the year</li>
            <li>35% of days last year had temperatures above 100&deg;F (38&deg;C) and almost 50% temperatures above 90&deg;F (32&deg;C)</li>
            <li>It's not uncommon for a summer day to be at least 100&deg;F (38&deg;C) for more than 12 hours</li>
        </ol>
        Phoenix seems to have a well deserved reputation as the "City Of The Sun" and is without a doubt a <em>hot</em> place to be.
